zmNinja is a multi platform client for ZoneMinder users.
This is a very initial version - I'll keep refining it over time as I learn more
of AngularJS and stuff.

Note that I am only currently testing on iOS as a platform for now

My plan is to make the iOS version work and then move to other platforms (Android)
can generate other plaforms

as I mentioned, expect to see many many changes over the next few weeks/months

Bugs/Issues
------------
a) There are MANY right now. Like I said, I'll be working over the next few weeks to clean it up
b) A lot of functionality is still missing - keep a tab
c) The ZM APIs are not fully functional. I unfortunately need to reply on ZM devs to fix them and that will depend on how soon they can address it


Important Notes
---------------
a) You need to have the latest ZM APIs installed. These apis are in the angular-ui branch of ZM.
If you don't know what that means, then you will have to wait till ZM folks integrate their APIs
into the main stream (the current APIs in 1.28 are limited - and will not be sufficient for the client)
