Thanks
------
To the zonemider community in general, and the awesome Stack Overflow community.
But specifically, [Andrew Bauer](https://github.com/knight-of-ni) (knight-of-ni) who egged me on to take up this project and [Isaac Connor](http://github.com/connortechnology/) who has been incredibly supportive in helping fix various ZM issues that affected zmNinja

Important Notes
---------------
* zmNinja needs APIs enabled in ZoneMinder. See [this](https://zmninja.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/validating-api.html) for instructions on how to make sure your APIs are working. If they are not working, zmNinja **will not** work.


Why did I develop zmNinja?
------------------------------
* I wanted to learn how to write a mobile app. It was (and is) fun. 
* I originally reached out to tinyCam to see if they were willing to do an app - did not get a response
* I found zmView limited for my needs
